// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Empty Array:

let items : string [] = []

items.push('Karachi');
items.push('Hyderabad');
items.push('Lahore');

console.log(items);
